#Text - Reverse a string

#This is kind of cheaty, but Python has slicing which allows for this.
#The syntax is "string_here"[start_index:end_index:step]
#Hence [::-1] indicates to slice target string from start to end, reversed.
#Slicing works for lists as well, in fact, it works on strings because strings are sort of a list.

print "Enter a sentence to be reversed below:"
target_string = raw_input()
new_string = target_string[::-1]
print "\nThe reversed string is as below:"
print new_string
